Notable hardware changes in A20-SOM's design betwen revisions

Hardware revision C
========

1. Added resistor 10M parallel to the RTC crystal.
2. Changed the RTC crystal to SMT package.
3. Edited web-site white print to https://www.olimex.com
4. D5 positioned further away from UART0 conectora.
5. Major canges to the routing of DDR3 and NAND memory, similar to LIME2's. 
6. Instead of test pads, added new connector with the following signals:
	-> FMINL, FMINR, TVIN2, TVIN3, VMIC_OUT, AXP_BACKUP, AXP_RST, AXP_PWRON, UBOOT_SEL, VDD_RTC and GND;
7. Added new option - PC17 could be used for NWP signal if necessary, but R22 should be placed in this case!

Hardware revision D
========

1. Added matrix RM3 for the VGA signals.
2. Added pads for optional capacitors C178, C179, C180, C181 (NA by default).
3. VDD_RTC's label fixed from 3V3/30mA to 1V3/30mA.

Hardware revision E
========

1. Added EEPROM on TWI1 line. EEPROM address 0x50. Can cause problems with devices that use I2C1 and same address 0x50. The EEPROM comes loaded with production information, refer to this repo for more information: https://github.com/OLIMEX/OLINUXINO/tree/master/SOFTWARE/A20/A20-eeprom-contents
2. Added eMMC option.
3. Added SPI flash option.
4. C162(220uF/6.3V/tant) changed to 4x47uF/6.3V/0805.
5. U2 and U3 changed from K4B4G1646D-BCK0 to MT41K256M16HA-125E(DDR3L-1600_11-11-11).

Hardware revision E1
=========

1. C193 and L9 pads added for ETXCK and components not placed (NA).
2. Added option to make the board with T2 chip instead of A20.
3. Change RTC crystal with 1206 one.
