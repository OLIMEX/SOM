This is the GitHub repository for Olimex System on Module (SOM) boards resources hardware and software.

OLIMEX System-on-Module (SOM) boards are powerful Linux-capable boards. They follow a low-cost modular design which allows rapid product development. Each of these boards has two parts - a main part which nests the processor, the memory and the power control unit; and a peripheral part which contains the USB ports, the video output and most of the connectors. SOM designs are targeted at customers who want to apply custom modifications and own solutions based on a specific processor without having to deal with multi layer PCBs with controlled impedance and BGA assembly. This makes it possible to create simpler boards (that might be manufactured by your local board manufacturer) containing only the peripherals you need with the dimensions and shape suitable for your specific solution.

Both the main part and the peripheral part of the SOM system have support in the official Android and Debian images distributed by Olimex and maintained by Olimex and the Linux community.

The peripheral part of the SOM design is considered Open Source HardWare (OSHW) and the customer has access to the board source files that we used to manufacture it. The part of the design that has the main microcontroller is considered proprietary design and design files would not be shared. The official Android and Debian images released for the SOM boards are open software. We usually try to provide step-by-step instructions on how we have compiled the images. These instructions might be found at the olimex wordpress page. 

If you are looking for the open source hardware design of the processors used, please, check the OLinuXino boards. OLinuXino board designs are fully open source hradware but harder to implement in own solutions and require more of a hardware experience to do so. Nevertheless OLinuXino boards are pretty good choice for evaluating the capabilities of the embedded processors.

At the moment Olimex deals with the following categories of SOM boards:

==Allwinner A13==

==Allwinner A20==

==Texas Instruments AM3352==

==Rockchip RK3188==

==Rockchip RK3328==

==STM STM32MP153==
